Creates an array of numbers (positive and/or negative) progressing from `start` up to, but not including, `end`. A step of -1 is used if a negative start is specified without an end or step. If end is not specified, it's set to start with start then set to `0`. The array's size is used as the end when a step of `0` is specified.


## Arguments
[start:=0] (number): The start of the range.
end (number): The end of the range.
[step:=1] (number): The value to increment or decrement by.


## Returns
(Array): Returns the range of numbers.
